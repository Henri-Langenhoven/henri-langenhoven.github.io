    <p>I had the same problem as <a
        href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/196821/how-to-render-object-in-front-of-everything-else">this
        StackExchange post</a>, and the one and only answer at the time of writing suggested making a new scene. I tried
      that at first, but it seemed to add unnecessary complexity and I got confused. Then I read the comments, and
      <a
        href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/196821/how-to-render-object-in-front-of-everything-else#comment330043_196822">this
        comment</a>,
      suggested making a separate view layer instead. I looked up the <a
        href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/render/layers/introduction.html">documentation on view layers</a>,
      and tried going with that solution. Because the comment didn't include steps though, I was still floundering
      around, until I looked at the <a href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/196822">answer</a> again, and happened
      to see what looked like "view layers" in one of the <a
        href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/196821/how-to-render-object-in-front-of-everything-else/196822#comment330043_196822:~:text=Share-,Improve%20this%20answer,-Follow">images</a>.
      So I investigated the "<a
        href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/compositing/introduction.html">Compositor</a>,"
      combined the two suggestions, and voilà!
    </p>
    <p>Without further ado, let's crunch the numbers:</p>

    <h3 id="make-a-new-view-layer">1. Make a new "View Layer"<a class="headerlink" href="#make-a-new-view-layer"
        title="Permanent link"></a></h3>

    <p>Click the button that looks like a copy icon (highlighted in the image below) top right above the Outliner (the
      scene view hierarchy thingy).</p>

      alt="new view layer" />

    <h3 id="make-the-background-transparent">2. Make the background transparent<a class="headerlink"
        href="#make-the-background-transparent" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>

    <p>This step is non-obvious and probably would have tripped me up, but thankfully I remembered something about
      transparency in the StackExchange
      <a
        href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/196821/how-to-render-object-in-front-of-everything-else#:~:text=The%20robot%20scene%20should%20have%20a%20transparent%20background%20(Select%20Film%20Transparent%20in%20the%20Rendering%20Properties%20menu).">answer</a>.
      It was in relation to multiple scenes but turns out it's still necessary for view layers. Click on the old-school
      camera icon in the right sidebar, scroll down to Film, expand it, then check the "Transparent" box.
