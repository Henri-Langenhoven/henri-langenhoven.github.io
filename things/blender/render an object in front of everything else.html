    <p>I had the same problem as <a
        href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/196821/how-to-render-object-in-front-of-everything-else">this
        StackExchange post</a>, and the one and only answer at the time of writing suggested making a new scene. I tried
      that at first, but it seemed to add unnecessary complexity and I got confused. Then I read the
      <a
        href="https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/196821/how-to-render-object-in-front-of-everything-else#comment330043_196822">comments</a>,
      which suggested making a separate view layer instead. I looked up the <a
        href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/4.5/render/layers/introduction.html">documentation on view layers</a>,
      and ended up going with that solution. Because the comment didn't include steps though, I was still floundering
      around, until I looked at the Compositor image of the StackExchange answer again, and saw it had view layers in
      there. I combined the two, and voilà!
